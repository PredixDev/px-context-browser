// IMPORTANT NOTE: Due to the limitations of the Shady DOM polyfill, it is
// difficult to ensure keyframe animations are in the right scope for slotted
// elements (see https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/4688). To solve this,
// the keyframe animations below are included in both the Shadow DOM of the
// component that has the elements that will animate slotted and in the
// host component that will be animated.
